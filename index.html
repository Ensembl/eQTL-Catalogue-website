<p>The eQTL Catalogue aims to provide uniformly processed gene expression and splicing QTLs from all available public studies on human.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h4>What are molecular quantitative trait loci (*QTL)?</h4>
<p>Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are genomic loci where variation is significantly associated to a measurable phenotype. This resource focuses on expression cis-QTLs (cis-eQTL) where variants are associated expression levels of nearby genes, and on splicing QTLs (sQTL) where variants are associate to specific splicing events on nearby splice junctions</p>
<p>To compute them we gather samples across a cohort of donors. Each sample is assayed for transcriptional activity and genotype. The allele at each locus is thus associated to the expression level at nearby genes, or to the splicing activity at nearby splice sites.</p>
	<h4>What are they used for?</h4>
<p>Gene expression and splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL and sQTL) studies are a powerful tool to link variants associated with complex traits with their potential target genes. Further details can be found on the Methods tab</p>
	<h4>How many datasets have we processed?</h4>
<p>We currently provide access to 15 published datasets, with an aim to cover all accessible published datasets on human. Further details can be found on the Datasets tab</p>
	<h4>How can I get access to the results?</h4>
<p>You can download our results via FTP in CSV and HDF5 formats, or query part of our data via our RESTful API. More details are available on the Data Access tab</p>

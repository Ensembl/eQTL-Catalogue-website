FTP Downloads
-------------

On our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/eQTL) you will find both tab-delimited flatfiles as well as HDF5 files. 

See our [tutorial](https://github.com/EBISPOT/SumStats/blob/eqtls/querying_hdf5_basics.ipynb) on reading the HDF5 files.

REST API
--------

You can also query slices of eQTL summary statistics (by study and/or gene and/or SNP) using our [RESTful API]({{ site.domain }}{{ site.baseurl }}/api-docs).

R Wrapper
---------

[Brian Schilder](https://github.com/bschilder) generously contributed this [R wrapper](https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/catalogueR) to access eQTL Catalogue data from R. More information can be found on his [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.924266v1).

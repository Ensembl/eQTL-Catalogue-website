FTP Downloads
-------------

On our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/eQTL) you will find both tab-delimited flatfiles as well as HDF5 files. 

See our [tutorial](https://github.com/EBISPOT/SumStats/blob/eqtls/querying_hdf5_basics.ipynb) on reading the HDF5 files.

API
---

You can also query slices of eQTL summary statistics (by study and/or gene and/or SNP) using our [RESTful API]({{ site.domain }}{{ site.baseurl }}/api-docs).

See our [tutorial](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kauralasoo/eQTL-Catalogue-resources/blob/master/scripts/eQTL_API_usecase.html) on performing colocalisation analysis with GWAS Catalog and eQTL Catalogue APIs in R. 

Expression Atlas
----------------

On the [dataset tab]({{ site.domain }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Datasets/), follow the links to Expression Atlas studies.
